As tech businesses become increasingly entangled in broader geopolitical disputes, their users and clients are feeling the heat. Huawei\\u2019s plan to unshackle imported chips is just one oft-cited example of the vulnerability of Chinese firms dependent on foreign tech.\\n\\nAnother area that has made the tech community restless is source code hosting. Chinese developers rely heavily on GitHub, as evident from an apparent government ban of the site in 2013 that prompted former Google China head Kai-Fu Lee to speak out. Now the China developer community is wary that political conflict may inflict GitHub.\\n\\nThe scenario is not without precedent. Last July, Microsoft-owned GitHub cut off certain services from users in U.S.-sanctioned countries, including Iran, Syria and Crimea, causing outrage and panic in the global developer community.\\n\\nSeven-year-old Gitee is at the center of China\\u2019s push to localize businesses\\u2019 source codes. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), one of China\\u2019s top tech policymakers, recently picked (in Chinese) Gitee to construct an \\u201cindependent, open-source code hosting platform for China.\\u201d\\n\\nThe project will be carried out by a consortium led by Open Source China, the Shenzhen-based firm behind its namesake open-source community and Gitee. The hosting service appears to be a government-led effort with support from research universities and participation from the private sector \\u2014 a group of 10 organizations including Huawei, which is itself suffering from supply chain disruption amid the political storm.\\n\\n\\u201cIf China does not have its own open-source community to maintain and manage source codes, our domestic software industry will be very vulnerable to uncontrollable factors,\\u201d said Huawei executive Wang Chenglu at an event last August, shortly after GitHub acted to comply with U.S. sanctions laws.\\n\\nGitee claims to have hosted more than 10 million open-source repositories and provided services to over 5 million developers so far. For comparison, GitHub reported having 100 million repositories and around 31 million developers worldwide last November.\\n\\nThe question is whether Gitee\\u2019s platform can convince Chinese developers to migrate from GitHub \\u2014 or its Tencent-backed local rival Coding.net \\u2014 now that industry titans are onboard to help. It\\u2019s also unclear whether GitHub will act to preempt export restrictions, as it hinted at the possibility when its executive told the Financial Times that it\\u2019s \\u201ckeen\\u201d to open a subsidiary in China.\\n\\nGitee is clearly confident there is space for a \\u201cChinese alternative\\u201d to GitHub.\\n\\n\\u201cThe world should be one where a hundred flowers bloom. The foreign market has GitHub and other kinds of foundations. In China, there are various organizations dedicated to evangelizing open source software, as well as Gitee,\\u201d wrote (in Chinese) Open Source China founder who goes by the nickname \\u201cHongshu,\\u201d or \\u201cSweet Potato.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAn open-source ecosystem can\\u2019t be built overnight. It\\u2019s a process of building a tower with sand. We have faith in the innovative power of Chinese developers. We also believe in our perseverance and strength to strive.\\u201d\",\n          \"Chad Wolf, the illegally appointed head of DHS, an agency that has allegedly overseen unnecessary hysterectomies on immigrant women, according to a new whistleblower\\u2019s complaint Photo : Susan Walsh ( AP )\\n\\nWhy have the terms \\u201cNazi Germany\\u201d and \\u201cMengele\\u201d become trending topics on Twitter? The words dominated the social media platform on Monday after it was revealed that a whistleblower has alleged \\u201chigh numbers\\u201d of immigrant women at a U.S. concentration camp in Georgia were sent to be given unnecessary hysterectomies. Many of the women reportedly didn\\u2019t know why they were being sent to have the surgery and were all sent to the same doctor, according to the complaint, with one woman describing the facility as an \\u201cexperimental concentration camp.\\u201d\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nTwitter users made several analogies to various Nazi atrocities on Monday, like the sadistic medical experiments performed on Jews by Josef Mengele during the Holocaust in the 1930s and \\u201840s. And while U.S. concentration camps aren\\u2019t currently operating as anything close to the European death camps of the Holocaust, there\\u2019s still reasonable concern about what the fuck is happening in the U.S. right now under the Trump regime.\\n\\nThe whistleblower, a nurse named Dawn Wooten, worked full time at a concentration camp run by Immigration and Customs Enforcement called the Irwin County Detention Center, until her work hours were cut in July, a result of alleged retaliation for speaking up internally about health and sanitary conditions in the prison. The facility is technically owned by a private company called LaSalle Corrections, much like several other ICE and CBP concentration camps across the U.S. that currently house tens of thousands of detainees under a for-profit model.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe complaint, which was submitted to the Office of the Inspector General at the Department of Homeland Security on September 14 by several human rights advocacy organizations like Project South, provides a disturbing peek behind the curtain of a highly secretive system. The American public has read about the psychological torture of children, the denial of basic necessities like soap and toothpaste, and the deaths of at least six immigrant children in U.S. custody since President Trump took power. But it\\u2019s apparently even worse than we previously imagined.\\n\\nThe conditions in the Georgia facility are abysmal, according to the complaint, citing several prisoners and unnamed medical staff. Detainees explained that the food provided was sometimes spoiled and that meals would even have ants and cockroaches.\\n\\nG/O Media may get a commission Aurora by Bellesa Buy for $74 from Bellesa Boutique Use the promo code AURORA25\\n\\n\\u201cThis is the dirtiest facility I have ever been in: everything is dirty; one shower for more than fifty people; one bathroom for all of us; I don\\u2019t even know how to give more details because it is all nasty, really nasty; only God is taking care of us here,\\u201d one immigrant told human rights workers, according to the complaint.\\n\\nMany of the allegations involve specific shortcomings to combat the covid-19 pandemic, such as a lack of PPE, but the most shocking revelations involve many women who were sent to have hysterectomies\\u2014a medical procedure to remove the uterus, rendering the women unable to become pregnant and have children\\u2014without getting a clear answer on why they were having the surgeries done.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nFrom the complaint to the OIG, which is available online:\\n\\nOne woman told Project South in 2019 that Irwin sends many women to see a particular gynecologist outside the facility but that some women did not trust him. She also stated that \\u201ca lot of women here go through a hysterectomy\\u201d at ICDC. More recently, a detained immigrant told Project South that she talked to five different women detained at ICDC between October and December 2019 who had a hysterectomy done. When she talked to them about the surgery, the women \\u201creacted confused when explaining why they had one done.\\u201d The woman told Project South that it was as though the women were \\u201ctrying to tell themselves it\\u2019s going to be OK.\\u201d She further said: \\u201cWhen I met all these women who had had surgeries, I thought this was like an experimental concentration camp. It was like they\\u2019re experimenting with our bodies.\\u201d\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe whistleblower, nurse Wooten, explained in her own words how one unnamed doctor was allegedly carrying out this mass sterilization effort on immigrant women. Wooten even called the doctor a \\u201cuterus collector\\u201d:\\n\\nEverybody he sees has a hysterectomy\\u2014just about everybody. He\\u2019s even taken out the wrong ovary on a young lady [detained immigrant woman]. She was supposed to get her left ovary removed because it had a cyst on the left ovary; he took out the right one. She was upset. She had to go back to take out the left and she wound up with a total hysterectomy. She still wanted children\\u2014so she has to go back home now and tell her husband that she can\\u2019t bear kids\\u2026 she said she was not all the way out under anesthesia and heard him [doctor] tell the nurse that he took the wrong ovary. [...] We\\u2019ve questioned among ourselves like goodness he\\u2019s taking everybody\\u2019s stuff out\\u2026That\\u2019s his specialty, he\\u2019s the uterus collector. I know that\\u2019s ugly\\u2026is he collecting these things or something...Everybody he sees, he\\u2019s taking all their uteruses out or he\\u2019s taken their tubes out. What in the world.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe complaint also alleges that the women in custody aren\\u2019t getting clear communication about what procedure is about to be done on them, with some medical staff in the facility allegedly using Google to translate things from English to Spanish before surgery. Some women were told conflicting things about why they needed to have hysterectomies, like one woman who was given three very different reasons:\\n\\nOne detained immigrant reported to Project South that staff at ICDC and the doctor\\u2019s office did not properly explain to her what procedure she was going to have done. She reported feeling scared and frustrated, saying it \\u201cfelt like they were trying to mess with my body.\\u201d When she asked what was being done to her body, she was given three different responses by three different individuals. She was originally told by the doctor that she had an ovarian cyst and was going to have a small twenty-minute procedure done drilling three small holes in her stomach to drain the cyst. The officer who was transporting her to the hospital told her that she was receiving a hysterectomy to have her womb removed. When the hospital refused to operate on her because her COVID-19 test came back positive for antibodies, she was transferred back to ICDC where the ICDC nurse said that the procedure she was going to have done entailed dilating her vagina and scraping tissue off. The nurse first told the detained immigrant she was going to get this procedure done because she had heavy bleeding, but then told her it was because she had a thick womb. The woman quickly responded that she never had heavy bleeding in her life and was never told by the doctor that she had a thick womb. Instead she stated that the doctor had described an entirely different procedure that did not involve scraping her vagina. She stated: \\u201cI tried to explain to her that something isn\\u2019t right; that procedure isn\\u2019t for me.\\u201d The nurse responded by getting angry and agitated and began yelling at her. She told Project South that seeing the nurse\\u2019s nervous and angry response confirmed \\u201cthat something was not right.\\u201d\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday morning, but sent out a statement to several news outlets insisting that, \\u201cin general, anonymous, unproven allegations, made without any fact-checkable specifics, should be treated with the appropriate skepticism they deserve.\\u201d Notably, that\\u2019s not a flat denial of the allegations. And DHS restricts access to the facilities to such a degree that journalists have previously tried to use drones just to get a look inside. Even members of Congress have struggled to get an unfiltered look at what\\u2019s happening in these facilities.\\n\\nICE and its parent agency, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, have a history of outright lies and running interference for objectively racist policies. The former head of DHS, Kirstjen Nielsen, lied to Congress on multiple occasions, claiming that the Trump regime did not have a policy of separating families at the U.S.-Mexico border. That was flatly wrong and Nielsen has never been held accountable for the lies, let alone the atrocities she committed against countless asylum seekers. The current head of DHS, Acting Secretary Chad Wolf, has never been confirmed by the Senate and the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office found last month that he was illegally appointed to his position in late 2019. Wolf is still the head of DHS.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe new allegations out of Georgia caused social media users on Monday to draw the most logical analogies to other crimes against humanity committed by people in recent history, such as the Nazis. The Nazis were obsessed with the \\u201cpurity\\u201d of race and ran several eugenics programs to purge humanity of \\u201cundesirables.\\u201d But, again, based on all the available evidence, the U.S. is not currently running extermination camps that will kill millions of people within the country\\u2019s borders.\\n\\nBut saying \\u201cwe\\u2019re not technically as bad as the Nazis\\u201d is a pretty low bar, and doesn\\u2019t excuse the current abuses being perpetrated against vulnerable communities by the Trump regime.

These foundational technologies\\u2014Linux, Kubernetes, Node.js\\u2014and many others that silently permeate our lives have one thing in common: open source.\\n\\nOpen source is a technology development and distribution methodology, where the codebase and all development\\u2014from setting a roadmap to building new features, fixing bugs, and writing documentation\\u2014is done in public. A governing body (a group of hobbyists, a company, or a foundation) publicly manages this work, which is most often done in a public repository on either GitHub or GitLab. Open source has two important, and somewhat counterintuitive, advantages: speed and security.\\n\\nWIRED OPINION ABOUT Kevin Xu is the author of Interconnected, a bilingual newsletter on tech, business, geopolitics, and US-China relations. He's an investor and adviser of open source startups at OSS Capital and served in the Obama White House. Jordan Schneider is the author of the ChinaTalk newsletter and host of the ChinaTalk podcast, posted on Lawfare.\\n\\nThese practices lead to faster technological developments, because a built-in global community of developers helps them mature, especially if the technology is solving a real problem. Top engineers also prefer to work with and on open source projects. Wrongly cast as secretive automatons, they are more often like artists, who prefer to learn, work, collaborate, and showcase what they\\u2019ve built in public, even when they are barely compensated for that work.\\n\\nBut doesn\\u2019t keeping a technology's codebase open make it more vulnerable to attack? In fact, exposing the codebase publicly for security experts and hackers to easily access and test is the best way to keep the technology secure and build trust with end users for the long haul. Sunlight is the best disinfectant, and open source is that sunlight in technology. Linux, the operating system, and Kubernetes, the cloud container orchestration system, are two of the most prominent examples.\\n\\nOpen source is not limited to software, but also impacts hardware development. RISC-V, first introduced in 2010 at UC Berkeley, is an open source chip design instruction set architecture\\u2014which tells a chip how to do basic computation, like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc. RISC-V is gaining traction in the hardware manufacturing space throughout the world, because it lowers barriers to entry and increases chip development speed. OpenRAN, an open source 5G networking stack that started gaining momentum in 2016, is also gaining more attention and has already been embraced by the UK and Japanese governments.\\n\\nUsing open source technology is now the fastest way new products get built and legacy technologies get replaced. Yet as US policymakers develop their industrial policy to compete with China, open source is conspicuously absent.\\n\\nBy leaning on the advantages of open source, policymakers can pursue an industrial policy to help the US compete in the 21st century in line with our broader values. The alternative is to continue a top-down process that picks winners and losers based on not just technology but also political influence, which only helps individual firms secure market share, not sparking innovation more broadly. A few billion more dollars won\\u2019t save Intel from its technical woes, but a healthier ecosystem leveraging open source technology and community would put the US in a better position for the future.\\n\\nOpen source technology allows for vendor-neutrality. Whether you\\u2019re a country or a company, if you use open source, you\\u2019re not locked in to another company\\u2019s technical stack, road map, or licensing agreements. After Linux was first created in 1991, it was widely adopted by large companies like Dell and IBM as a vendor-neutral alternative to Microsoft\\u2019s Windows operating system. In the future, chip designers won\\u2019t be locked into Intel or ARM with RISC-V. With OpenRAN, 5G network builders won\\u2019t be forced to buy from Huawei, Nokia, or Ericsson.\\n\\nHowever, open source is not the panacea to all problems. By definition, anyone can run, change, copy, and distribute an open source technology. Thus, the technology and knowledge transfer can go to friends or foes. Indeed, China\\u2019s technology sector is starting to embrace open source\\u2014a sensible thing to do for a country looking to maintain its rapid growth and establish technological self-reliance in the face of US sanctions.\\n\\nThis should not scare American policymakers, because the core values of open source\\u2014transparency, openness, and collaboration\\u2014play to America\\u2019s strengths. The Department of Defense is one of the largest consumers of open source technologies and is well versed in the intricacies and nuances. A few federal agencies have also open-sourced their code, as part of the Federal Source Code policy instituted during the waning days of the Obama administration in 2016. Among other things, this policy requires all federal agencies to open-source 20 percent of their custom-made codebase. Today, anyone can find and use the code open-sourced from these departments on code.gov. Both the policy and the code repositories are managed publicly and transparently\\u2014as all good open source projects should be.\",\n          \"Exclusive: Mexico may extend relaxed bank credit rules to help economy grow MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico\\u2019s finance ministry is considering extending relaxed banking credit rules to help its battered economy recover, a top official said on Wednesday, after it presented an austere 2021 budget that leaves little room to maneuver.\\n\\nMexican Deputy Finance Minister Gabriel Yorio is seen during an interview with Reuters at the National Palace in Mexico City, Mexico September 9, 2020. REUTERS/Henry Romero\\n\\nDeputy Finance Minister Gabriel Yorio said the ministry was in talks with the banking industry and the central bank about the possible extension until next year of the temporary measures designed to avoid defaults and loss of collateral.\\n\\nThe measures were introduced earlier this year as part of the government\\u2019s strategy to reduce the impact of the coronavirus containment in the country, which is still scarred by memories of the 1995 \\u201cTequila crisis,\\u201d when Mexicans lost homes and savings.\\n\\nYorio said he hoped an extension could be announced within a \\u201ccouple of weeks,\\u201d while suggesting the facilities could be restricted to certain sectors of the economy to limit risks to the financial system.\\n\\nEarlier this year, the finance ministry and the central bank agreed to loosen credit quality restrictions for banks. In turn, banks were able to offer borrowers repayment options so as to avoid defaults.\\n\\n\\u201cWhat we have to do, maybe, is be selective with the sectors,\\u201d Yorio said.\\n\\nIndustries that had already reopened and potentially had better cash flow might be excluded, he said, to focus resources on others, such as airlines, that would face a slow recovery.\\n\\nOn Tuesday the government unveiled a lean budget that aims to reduce the country\\u2019s debt as a proportion of GDP in 2021 even as it struggles with high coronavirus infections and a slow economic recovery.\\n\\nSpeaking in an interview at the National Palace a day after the budget, Yorio acknowledged that it could take two to three years for Mexico\\u2019s economy to reach its pre-pandemic size.\\n\\n\\u201cIf the economic opening is delayed, it might take us even more time,\\u201d he said, adding that the recovery was a concern for credit ratings agencies which have Mexico on a negative outlook.\\n\\nRatings agencies have Mexico\\u2019s bonds still several notches above speculative grade, or junk. But investors increasingly worry that they will eventually follow those of state oil company Petroleos Mexicanos in its descent into junk.\\n\\n\\u201cThey all measure the credit risk...that\\u2019s why it is important to maintain stable debt,\\u201d Yorio said.\\n\\n\\u201cBut the second most important variable is in terms of growth,\\u201d he said, adding that the risk of a downgrade was one of the main worries in the ministry.\\n\\nPresident Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has been an outlier among both wealthy and emerging nations, insisting on tight spending limits even as the economy fell in the deepest recession since the 1930s Great Depression.\\n\\nLatin America\\u2019s second-largest economy was already in a mild recession before the pandemic.\\n\\nThe room for economic stimulus from budget measures was constrained in a country that collects just 15% of GDP in tax, Yorio said, hence the need to turn to the financial system to support growth.\\n\\n\\u201cNot all measures have to come from the budget,\\u201d he said.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
